### ‚öôÔ∏è While the scraper is running

During the run, the actor will output log messages letting you know what is going on at any point. Each message always contains specific information about the process including which url / page the actor is working on.

If you provide invalid inputs to the actor, it will immediately stop with a failure state and output log messages explaining what is wrong. If you are unsure what went wrong feel free to open up an issue in the issue tab.
